## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS FOR APK DEPLOYMENT**

### **1. Test Preview APK Build (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Run this command to test your build pipeline:
npm run build:preview

# This will:
# - Build a preview APK for testing
# - Validate your app configuration
# - Show any build errors before production
```

### **2. Create Production Firebase Project (15 minutes)**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Create new project: "fit-match-production"
3. Enable Authentication (Google + Email/Password)
4. Create Firestore database (production mode)
5. Enable Storage
6. Copy production config keys

### **3. Environment Separation (10 minutes)**
```bash
# Create .env.production with your production Firebase keys:
# EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=fit-match-production
# EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_production_key
# etc.
```

### **4. Production APK Build (10 minutes)**
```bash
# Once environment is set up:
npm run build:production

# This creates an AAB file for Google Play Store
```

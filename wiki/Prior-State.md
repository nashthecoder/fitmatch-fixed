  - `react-native-video` - Video playback
  - `react-native-toast-message` - User notifications
  - `dayjs` - Date manipulation
  - `react-native-ui-datepicker` - Date selection
- **Impact**: Build failures and missing functionality

### 2. Development Scripts
**Status**: Basic Configuration
- **Missing Scripts**:
  - `lint:fix` - Automated linting fixes
  - `type-check` - TypeScript compilation verification
  - `build` - Production build command
  - `dev` - Development with dev client
- **Impact**: Inefficient development workflow

## üèó Architecture and Organization Issues

### 1. Project Structure
**Status**: Inconsistent Organization
- **Issues**:
  - Mixed file naming conventions
  - Inconsistent directory structure
  - Poor separation of concerns
  - Import/export patterns varied significantly
- **Impact**: Difficult navigation and code organization

### 2. Configuration Files
**Status**: Missing or Incomplete
- **Missing/Incomplete**:
  - `.env.example` for environment configuration
  - Proper `.gitignore` patterns
  - Enhanced npm scripts
  - Build configuration optimization
- **Impact**: Setup difficulties for new developers

## üîß Development Experience Issues

### 1. IDE Support
**Status**: Poor Developer Experience
- **Issues**:
  - IntelliSense not working due to TypeScript configuration
  - Import resolution failures
  - No proper type checking
  - Inconsistent error reporting
- **Impact**: Slow development and increased bugs

### 2. Code Quality Tools
**Status**: Non-functional
- **Issues**:
  - ESLint rules not properly enforced
  - TypeScript compilation errors ignored
  - No automated code quality checks
  - Manual code review burden
- **Impact**: Technical debt accumulation

## üì± Application Functionality Status

### ‚úÖ Working Features (Before Improvements)
- **Basic Authentication**: Email and Google sign-in functionality
- **Firebase Integration**: Database and storage connections established

## üöÄ Need for Improvement

The prior state clearly demonstrated the need for comprehensive improvements across:

1. **Code Quality**: Establish consistent, maintainable code standards
2. **Architecture**: Implement proper state management and organization
3. **Developer Experience**: Create efficient development workflows
4. **Performance**: Optimize for better user experience
5. **Maintainability**: Reduce technical debt for long-term sustainability

This foundation of challenges set the stage for the comprehensive improvement initiative that followed, transforming FitMatch into a modern, maintainable, and scalable React Native application.
